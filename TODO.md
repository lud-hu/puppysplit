- look at all TODOs in the code
- features:
  - add "mark settled/not yet settled" button for each debt (adding a debt neutralising the debt)
  - split expenses not equally between all selected members but with different shares
  - split expenses not equally between all selected members but with different amounts
  - add expense type "income", so basically just a negative expense. e.g. if someone got the deposit back
