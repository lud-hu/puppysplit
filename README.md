# Puppysplit üê∂

Puppysplit is an app that allows you to easily split costs in a group of people e.g. when being on a weekend skiing trip or climbing holiday.
It originated in a test project for a web stack based on HTMX. It still a proof of concept so the code may not be as nice as it could get and it's pretty simple in functionality for now.

This repo is based on the BETH stack:
